The files contained here are plans for a 2-channel 5v light controller using an ESP32-C3. They were
created in the free and open-source [KiCad](https://kicad.org)

There is also an STL file, 7mm_cable_gland.stl, which I created and printed in a urethane resin to
create water-resistant fittings for the project box for the
["YETOR Waterproof Connectors 2 Wire"](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WDBLFDN) and power cord to enter
through. It's set for a 3/4" hole (large enough to fit the low voltage connector heads through).
